[My Notes](notes.md)

Drop a Memory is an online guest book for your home, allowing visitors to leave memories of their visit.

## ðŸš€ Specification Deliverable

> [!NOTE]
> For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

-   [x] Proper use of Markdown
-   [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
-   [x] Description of key features
-   [x] Description of how you will use each technology
-   [x] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

It's important to remember. Remember past experiences, past conversations, past friends. Yet despite this, in our hustle and bustle, in our busy daily lives, we often don't have the time or don't make the effort to record these small, important moments. But our homes can show small snapshots of our lives. That's where Drop A Memory comes in. Home owners post a QR code or url in their home, which links to their personal Drop A Memory room. Visitors take 30 seconds to visit the website to leave a small description of their activities (to drop a memory), creating a living record of all the visitors, memories and experiences in the home.

### Design

### Key features

-   Create an account to start your personal room as the admin
-   Login to your personal account through HTTPS
-   Ability for admin to delete specific memories
-   Access any user's room with their personal url
-   View all memories left by past visitors
-   Add new memories which are stored in a database
-   See memories update in real time

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

-   **HTML** - I will use HTML to create the structure of the application. It will have 3 main pages, one for login, one for viewing memories, and one for adding a memory.
-   **CSS** - I will use CSS to style the application and make it mobile and desktop friendly, with a modern responsive design.
-   **React** - I will use React to add responsive functionality and to handle the website routing. I will use it to submit API requests and automatically hot-refresh the screen when new information is received. I will use React Router to direct users from page to page, and route parameters to bring users to a specific room without having to login.
-   **Service** - Backend service that includes endpoints to:
    -   `create account` - which creates a new room.
    -   `login` - which routes a user to their personal room and sets them as an admin.
    -   `add memory` - which adds a new memory to the database.
    -   `remove memory` - which removes an existing memory from the database.
    -   `retrieve image` - which calls UnsplashAPI to help users search and select a stock image that represents the memory being described.
-   **DB/Login** - The database would likely have two tables - one for users and one for memories. Each memory row would store a timestamp, name, description, optionally a photo url, and the username to link the memory to the correct room.
-   **WebSocket** - I will use WebSockets so that all users connected can instantly see changes made to the database, including memories added or memories removed.

-   [x] **Images** - I displayed two images as part of the memories.
-   [x] **Login placeholder** - There is a placeholder to login and to create the account that right now just routes you to the correct pages and displays "User" instead of anything else.
