# Your startup name here

[My Notes](notes.md)

A brief description of the application here. I'm going to make a really cool startup, I'm just not quite sure yet what that is going to be yet.

## 🚀 Specification Deliverable

> [!NOTE]
> Fill in this sections as the submission artifact for this deliverable. You can refer to this [example](https://github.com/webprogramming260/startup-example/blob/main/README.md) for inspiration.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

-   [ ] Proper use of Markdown
-   [ ] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
-   [ ] Description of key features
-   [ ] Description of how you will use each technology
-   [ ] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

It's important to remember. Remember past experiences, past conversations, past friends. Yet despite this, in our hustle and bustle, in our busy daily lives, we often don't have the time or don't make the effort record these small, important moments. But our homes can be small snapshots of our lives. That's where Drop A Memory comes in. Home owners post a QR code or url in their home, guiding guests to their personal Drop A Memory room. Visitors, on the way out, visit the website to leave a small description and living record of all the memories and experiences shared.
